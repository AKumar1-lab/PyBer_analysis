# PyBer_analysis
Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib 

## Objective: 
Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using the power of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and SciPy.

## Resources: 
Data Source:  pyber.ipynb; Pyber_Challenge.ipynb; city_data.csv; ride_data.csv; 

Software: Anaconda 3.8.8, Python, Pandas Library, Matplotlib, Numpy, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of project
Matplotlib was used to create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, and box-and-whisker plots, and make them visually compelling and informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors. An introduction to SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Using Pandas, SciPy, and NumPy to perform summary statistics in creating visualizations of rideshare data to the CEO and for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Background
The CEO of Pyber has assigned a brand-new assignment. Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data is created by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib,  a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type.

Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.

Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis.
